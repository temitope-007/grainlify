//! # Canonical Error Enum for Program Escrow
//!
//! This module defines the single canonical error enum for all public program-escrow
//! entrypoints. Clients should use this enum to parse failures consistently.
//!
//! ## Error Code Ranges
//!
//! - **1-99**: General errors (authorization, validation, state)
//! - **100-199**: Program management errors
//! - **200-299**: Fund operation errors
//! - **300-399**: Payout errors
//! - **400-499**: Schedule errors
//! - **500-599**: Claim errors
//! - **600-699**: Dispute errors
//! - **700-799**: Fee errors
//! - **800-899**: Circuit breaker errors
//! - **900-999**: Threshold monitoring errors
//! - **1000-1099**: Batch recovery errors
//!
//! ## Security Notes
//!
//! - Error messages do NOT contain sensitive data (addresses, amounts, etc.)
//! - Error codes are stable and documented for client integration
//! - All errors are deterministic and reproducible

use soroban_sdk::contracterror;

/// Stable error code returned when a Draft program is used for Active-only operations.

/// Canonical error enum for all public program-escrow entrypoints.
///
/// This enum consolidates all possible errors that can be returned by the
/// program-escrow contract. Clients should match on these error codes to
/// handle failures consistently.
///
/// # Error Code Stability
///
/// Error codes are stable and will not change without a major version bump.
/// New error variants may be added in future versions, but existing codes
/// will remain unchanged.
///
/// # Security
///
/// Error messages are intentionally generic and do not contain sensitive data
/// such as addresses, amounts, or internal state. This prevents information
/// leakage through error channels.
